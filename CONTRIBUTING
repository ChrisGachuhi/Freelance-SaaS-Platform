# Contributing Guide for Freelance SaaS Platform

Welcome to the Freelance SaaS Platform project. This guide explains how to contribute in a structured, professional way. Please read it carefully and refer to it whenever you are unsure about the workflow.

## 1. Purpose of This Project

This is a learning and development project to:
- Build a full-featured freelance marketplace SaaS platform.
- Document every lesson, design, and implementation.
- Follow real-world software engineering practices.

## 2. Project Workflow (Modus Operandi)

We follow a clear workflow:
- All work begins from an Issue on GitHub.
- Every feature, lesson, or task is tracked on the Project Board.
- Code is written in feature branches based off `staging`.
- All feature branches are merged into `staging` first.
- After testing on `staging`, changes are merged into `main`.

## 3. Branching Strategy

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/<short-description>` – for new features (e.g. `feature/auth-module`)
- `bugfix/<short-description>` – for fixing bugs (e.g. `bugfix/login-error`)
- `hotfix/<short-description>` – for urgent production fixes

Branch from `staging` unless otherwise agreed.

## 4. How to Contribute Code

1. Sync your local staging branch:
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging

2. Create a feature branch:
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>

3. Write code:
- Ensure it addresses the linked issue.
- Follow coding conventions.

4. Commit clearly:
git add .
git commit -m "Add <short description of change>"

5. Push your branch:
git push origin feature/<short-description>


6. Open a Pull Request (PR):
- PR should target `staging`.
- Link it to the related Issue using GitHub keywords (e.g. `Closes #12`).
- Fill in the PR template.

7. Wait for review:
- Feedback will be provided in comments.

8. Merge to staging:
- Once approved, your PR will be merged into `staging`.
- When staging is stable, we merge to `main`.

## 5. Pull Request Checklist
Before creating a PR:
- The code compiles without errors.
- The code solves the intended issue or task.
- The PR is linked to the relevant Issue.
- The PR description is clear and meaningful.

## 6. Project Board Usage
- Every task or lesson will have an Issue.
- Issues are linked to cards on the Project Board.
- Move cards as appropriate:
- Start working → Move card to `In Progress`.
- Task completed → Move card to `Completed`.
- Link your PR to the card’s Issue.

## 7. Communication
- All questions, clarifications, or ideas should be raised as Issues (use the `mentee-question` label).
- You can also comment directly on relevant Issues or PRs.
- Be clear in your questions. Reference specific files, lines, or concepts.

## 8. Tips for Success
- Never code directly on `staging` or `main`.
- Small, focused branches are better than large, complex ones.
- Always sync `staging` before starting a new branch.
- Keep your commit messages meaningful and concise.
- Link everything: PRs to Issues, Issues to Project Board.
- Ask for help early when stuck.
